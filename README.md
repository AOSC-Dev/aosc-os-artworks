# AOSC OS Artworks (2017-2018)

This repository contains all wallpapers to be used as default for all Core 5
series AOSC OS releases.

## Download

A package pre-built wallpapers is available for you to download...

[Download Here](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/aosc-os-artworks/releases/download/v20170923/aosc-os-artworks-20170923.tar.xz)

When downloaded, un-tar the package to the root directory `/`.

## Build It Yourself

You will need Inkscape to build these wallpapers... Do note though, as we
default to quite some high output resolutions, and given the wallpapers'
complexity, it may require quite some time to build (but yes, parallelism
is available, `make -j` to engage).

```bash
make && sudo make install
```
